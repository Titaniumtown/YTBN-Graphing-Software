## TODO:
1. Function management
	- Integrals between functions (too hard to implement, maybe will shelve)
	- Display intersection between functions (would have to rewrite a lot of the function plotting handling)
	- Sort by UUIDs
	- [Drag and drop support](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/1530) in the UI
	- Hide/disable functions
2. Smart display of graph
	- Display of intersections between functions
3. Allow constants in min/max integral input (like pi or euler's number)
4. Sliding values for functions (like a user-interactable slider that adjusts a variable in the function, like desmos)
5. Fix integral display
6. Better handling of panics and errors to display to the user
7. Turn Dynamic Iterator functions into traits
8. Better handling of roots and extrema finding
9. Add closing animation for function entry
10. Create actual icon(s) for PWA/favicon (using placeholder from eframe_template)
11. Fix mobile text input
