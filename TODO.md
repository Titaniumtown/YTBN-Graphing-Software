## TODO:
1. Function management
	- Integrals between functions (too hard to implement, maybe will shelve)
	- Prevent user from making too many function entries
2. Smart display of graph
3. Allow constants in min/max integral input (like pi or euler's number)
4. Sliding values for functions (like a user-interactable slider that adjusts a variable in the function, like desmos)
5. Fix integral display
6. Better handling of roots and extrema finding
7. Add closing animation for function entry
8. Fix mobile text input
9. Write custom plotter
10. Add Url hashes loading and setting
11. Store settings in LocalStorage/Cookies and persist state
12. Set x value to go to
