## TODO:
1. Function management
	- Integrals between functions (too hard to implement, maybe will shelve)
	- Display intersection between functions (would have to rewrite a lot of the function plotting handling)
	- [Drag and drop support](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/1530) in the UI to re-order functions
	- Hide/disable functions
	- Prevent user from making too many function entries
	- Display function errors as tooltips or a warning box (not preventing the display of the graph)
	- Clone functions
	- Better integration with egui's legend
2. Smart display of graph
	- Display of intersections between functions
3. Allow constants in min/max integral input (like pi or euler's number)
4. Sliding values for functions (like a user-interactable slider that adjusts a variable in the function, like desmos)
5. Fix integral display
6. Turn Dynamic Iterator functions into traits
7. Better handling of roots and extrema finding
8. Add closing animation for function entry
9. Create actual icon(s) for PWA/favicon (using placeholder from eframe_template)
10. Fix mobile text input
11. Write custom plotter
12. Add Url hashes loading and setting
13. Store settings in LocalStorage/Cookies and persist state
