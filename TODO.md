## TODO:
1. Multiple functions in one graph.
	- Backend support
		- Integrals between functions (too hard to implement, maybe will shelve)
	- UI
		- Different colors (kinda)
2. Rerwite of function parsing code
	- Non `y=` functions.
3. Smart display of graph
	- Display of intersections between functions
4. re-add euler's number (well it works if you use capital e like `E^x`)
5. allow constants in min/max integral input (like pi or euler's number)
6. sliding values for functions (like a user-interactable slider that adjusts a variable in the function, like desmos)
7. Keybinds
8. nth derivative support (again)
9. Update function tests
10. rewrite FunctionEntry to move more information and handling to egui_app (such as config changes)
11. Threading
12. fix integral display
13. Improve loading indicator
14. Hash asset tarball and compare hash on runtime
15. add comments in `parsing::process_func_str` for it to be better understandable
