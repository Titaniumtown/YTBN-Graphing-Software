## TODO:
1. Multiple functions in one graph.
	- Backend support
		- Integrals between functions (too hard to implement, maybe will shelve)
		- Display intersection between functions
		- Different colors
2. Rerwite of function parsing code
	- Non `y=` functions.
3. Smart display of graph
	- Display of intersections between functions
4. Allow constants in min/max integral input (like pi or euler's number)
5. Sliding values for functions (like a user-interactable slider that adjusts a variable in the function, like desmos)
6. nth derivative support (again)
7. Threading (Partially mplemented when running natively)
8. Fix integral display
9. Look into other, better methods of compression that would be faster
10. Better handling of panics and errors to display to the user
11. Turn Dynamic Iterator functions into traits
12. __Update tests__
