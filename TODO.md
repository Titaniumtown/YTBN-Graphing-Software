## TODO:
1. Function management
	- Integrals between functions (too hard to implement, maybe will shelve)
	- Display intersection between functions (would have to rewrite a lot of the function plotting handling)
	- [Drag and drop support](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/1530) in the UI to re-order functions
	- Hide/disable functions
	- Prevent user from making too many function entries
	- Display function errors as tooltips or a warning box (not preventing the display of the graph)
	- Clone functions
2. Smart display of graph
	- Display of intersections between functions
3. Allow constants in min/max integral input (like pi or euler's number)
4. Sliding values for functions (like a user-interactable slider that adjusts a variable in the function, like desmos)
5. Fix integral display
6. Better handling of roots and extrema finding
7. Add closing animation for function entry
8. Fix mobile text input
9. Write custom plotter
10. Add Url hashes loading and setting
11. Store settings in LocalStorage/Cookies and persist state
