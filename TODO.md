## TODO:
1. Multiple functions in one graph.
    - Backend support
        - Integrals between functions (too hard to implement, maybe will shelve)
    - UI
        - Different colors (kinda)
2. Rerwite of function parsing code
    - Non `y=` functions.
3. Display of intersections between functions
4. Fix integral line
