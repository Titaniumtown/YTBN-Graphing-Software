### What is this?
The aim of this project is to provide a [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/)-like graphing experience. This project is written in rust and takes advantage of [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) as it's graphical backend. Meaning that this program can be deployed as both a site ([such as here](https://titaniumtown.github.io)) and as a native application that runs on your machine.
